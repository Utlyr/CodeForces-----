[1, n]. Suppose the first one to give a non-zero answer is [1, i]. Let that answer be R. Then, since all prefixes before [1, i] gave 0 as an answer, the string over [0, i-1] is i-1-R 1's followed by R 0's. Also s[i] must be 1. To determine the suffix s[i+1, n], we query over the prefixes still [1, i+1], [1, i+2] ... [1, n], and, at each query, if the answer increases from the previous one, we have a 1 there, otherwise it is 0 there. In total, we take exactly 1 query for each char in s[2, n], meaning we require n-1 queries.</p></li> </ul><p>Does anyone know if there is something wrong here?</p></div>",0
