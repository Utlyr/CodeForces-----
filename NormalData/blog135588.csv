If you approach is because you are already going to use one point to get even points then you are correct but making such mess in the same line? Cause later you are doing i==1 which means you are skipping a element at position = 0. Which again makes no sense cause you can pair any of the i so why position i=0 is getting a priority?</p><p>iii) (num[i]-num[i-1]+1)/2 &lt;= mid makes no sense because the new point you will be placing will be not at the middle it will be anywhere ITS FREE WILL. By placing it at the middle of num[i] and num[i-1] gives no contribution cause you are meant to stick the power up for the first element that violates the &lt;=mid thing with its next right neighbor (according to greedy approach).</p><p>I hope you understand that you have just written many wrong things and messy in a single line.</p><p>Dont be sad or angry about it.

1215955,1730786843,mithudonbadmosh,en,"<div class=""ttypography""><p>For problem D </p><p>The approach to this problem starts by precomputing powers of 2 up to the maximum needed range. This allows us to quickly apply these powers to elements without recalculating them each time, making the solution more efficient. For each element in the array, we break it down into two parts: an odd part and the largest power of 2 it can be divided by. This decomposition is useful because it lets us keep track of how much &quot;doubling power&quot; each element has.</p><p>To efficiently combine elements and maximize the sum, we use a stack. For each new element in the prefix, we check if we can combine it with elements already in the stack to get the highest possible sum. We do this by removing elements from the stack that have lower effective doubling power, adding their contribution to the sum, and redistributing powers to make the current element as strong as possible. After processing each element, we push it onto the stack, updating the sum for the current prefix.</p><p>Finally, we output the maximum sum for each prefix, taking results modulo to handle large numbers. This approach naturally follows from the problem’s constraints, as maximizing sums by doubling requires managing powers of 2 and combining elements optimally. As a result, it’s not unusual for solutions to resemble each other since the problem’s setup leads directly to this method.</p></div>",0
