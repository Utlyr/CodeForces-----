This allows us to quickly apply these powers to elements without recalculating them each time, making the solution more efficient. For each element in the array, we break it down into two parts: an odd part and the largest power of 2 it can be divided by. This decomposition is useful because it lets us keep track of how much \u0026quot;doubling power\u0026quot; each element has.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo efficiently combine elements and maximize the sum, we use a stack. For each new element in the prefix, we check if we can combine it with elements already in the stack to get the highest possible sum. We do this by removing elements from the stack that have lower effective doubling power, adding their contribution to the sum, and redistributing powers to make the current element as strong as possible. After processing each element, we push it onto the stack, updating the sum for the current prefix.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFinally, we output the maximum sum for each prefix, taking results modulo to handle large numbers. This approach naturally follows from the problem‚Äôs constraints, as maximizing sums by doubling requires managing powers of 2 and combining elements optimally. As a result, it‚Äôs not unusual for solutions to resemble each other since the problem‚Äôs setup leads directly to this method.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","rating":0},{"id":1222151,"creationTimeSeconds":1732783455,"commentatorHandle":"kagelov","locale":"en","text":"\u003cdiv class\u003d\"ttypography\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t still\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","parentCommentId":1215795,"rating":0},{"id":1227341,"creationTimeSeconds":1734099179,"commentatorHandle":"conoda","locale":"en","text":"\u003cdiv class\u003d\"ttypography\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eopen the dm for a second \u003ca class\u003d\"rated-user user-red\" href\u003d\"/profile/Umi\" title\u003d\"Grandmaster Umi\"\u003eUmi\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","parentCommentId":1213230,"rating":0}]}
