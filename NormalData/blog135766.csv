I heard that F and G were actually fun, so I will upsolve those and hope to feel the same way, however for the first 60% of the contest, it was quite bad. Tasks should, even if educational, have some observations. Not only was D lacking observations, it wasn't even educational, anyone could mindsolve in a very short amount of time, and it would fully depend on whether they could implement well or not. While that is still skill dependent to some extent, tasks should be educational imo, as that is the true value this site provides in the first place. E was ok, however it could have been written more clearly. While I know I've said some harsh things here, its because I'd like to see improvement from the authors in the future if they decide to continue setting rounds.

Meanwhile top competitors implemented this quite easily, which shows I have a lot of work to do to improve even the implementation of solution after understanding what is required.</p><p>On another note, it is very disappointing how many cheaters compete on CodeForces. It becomes evident if trying to have a go at hacking that a large amount of contestants are blatantly copy and pasting code directly from ChatGPT and/or copying solutions from others. There was such a blatant group of cheaters for Problem E that I had to post here for documentation purposes.

Finding <code>c-1</code> may not work because of how lower bound works: it finds the suitable position for <code>c-1</code>, that position can have the value <code>c</code> as well. So you'll have to take extra steps to make sure you are avoiding a bad high index with <code>c</code>. Unfortunatly, I made a silly mistake somewhat similar to this.

My solution was flagged for violating Codeforces’ plagiarism policies. I am writing this comment to explain to the organizers that it was purely coincidental that, out of 32,995 participants, my solution was similar to that of 30 other participants — a similarity rate of just 0.09%. This minor probability of similarity can occur, as the approach to the problem was straightforward; while the logic might resemble other solutions, the variable names and their handling in my code differ significantly.</p><p>All participants with similar solutions, including myself, used C++ to submit the answer, as the problem required an approach that naturally aligns with a deque-style method using specific variables like n and k, as outlined in the prompt. While the overall approach may seem similar, the specific handling of elements within my code is distinct.</p><p>This situation reflects poorly on the sponsoring team, as it discourages participants who invest their time in the contest only to receive a plagiarism penalty for such a negligible similarity of less than 0.1%. I am sharing both my code and that of another user to show that, although we followed a similar approach, the variable naming and output methods in my code are unique. My variable naming style remains consistent across contests, demonstrating my approach to problem-solving. Additionally, given that solutions often follow a linear sequence, many steps inevitably look similar across languages, contributing further to these coincidences.</p><p>My code: Submission link: <a href=""https://codeforces.com/contest/2036/submission/289574722"">https://codeforces.com/contest/2036/submission/289574722</a> Second code: Submission link: <a href=""https://codeforces.com/contest/2036/submission/289549723"">https://codeforces.com/contest/2036/submission/289549723</a></p><p>Msg I received from team : &quot;Attention!</p><p>Your solution 289574722 for the problem 2036E significantly coincides with solutions kanose7734/289549723, Sana_Azeem5/289550646, Yasin_MalekAlaie/289551343, yaduvanshi_23/289552002, adityavermanov/289552027, hkm_12345/289552059, priyajgangwar1/289552369, competitivecoder96/289553096, TheFatCoder/289553363, WrongAnswerAtTest1/289554884, gopi2005/289555485, tsundere_/289556958, meetanupam/289557228, Coderv55/289557451, addme/289557594, sanhayu546/289557896, Barun34/289558238, faruk_kk/289558267, king2008/289559182, Thavar/289559273, Surgeon_of_Hell/289560879, Devendra_19/289561369, chandan_7499/289562386, java_unfriendme_/289563028, Nooooooooooooooobbxhj/289563164, rito_b/289564867, Aman6523/289565402, tleTauhid/289565714, Ashwinikumar23/289565761, viveksahus9368646191/289565963, Hitler_10/289566931, Proff_Shawn/289567180, hassan.masry1979/289567442, flamingo123/289568361, rohangarg1446/289568731, thecodereal55/289569272, i.ravi.pratap/289569547, Abhishek_Das_003/289569975, code_100m_amgf/289571326, yuv5120/289571633, anjali_4876/289571788, ayushisharma04/289572399, ashrafbhai005/289572862, -333/289572907, garvit27/289574722, Satyam8932/289575263, ashrafulalam005/289576543, purvk/289577280, akshar_bansal/289578363, Parthavinolover/289587465, <strong>Er</strong>/289588574, SinC_Nohara/289589042, ill.soul/289589212, 015-Daniil-M-2027/289589305, im_subhash/289589644, sanskardhyani98/289591022, yerwxzq/289591708, Tanishq_codegrandmaster2/289592436, Om3466/289594176, Jayesh_02/289594259, Tah1rTheT1ger/289594506, kaido7/289594658, Mubtasim_92/289595881.

My similarity rate was a ~0.3% but this is still low to possibly consider my submission a flag. This was purely a coincidence as using sets is a common way to solve this problem.

This is why I then wrote my solution in C++ because its compiler is faster and used sets to further decrease my time complexity. As a person who knows multiple programming languages, I tend to switch between python and c++ depending on the context of the problem. </p><p>I completely agree with you about how this discourages people in participating in contests.
