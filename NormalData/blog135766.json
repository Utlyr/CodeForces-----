My solution was flagged for violating Codeforces’ plagiarism policies. I am writing this comment to explain to the organizers that it was purely coincidental that, out of 32,995 participants, my solution was similar to that of 30 other participants — a similarity rate of just 0.09%. This minor probability of similarity can occur, as the approach to the problem was straightforward; while the logic might resemble other solutions, the variable names and their handling in my code differ significantly.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAll participants with similar solutions, including myself, used C++ to submit the answer, as the problem required an approach that naturally aligns with a deque-style method using specific variables like n and k, as outlined in the prompt.

I am sharing both my code and that of another user to show that, although we followed a similar approach, the variable naming and output methods in my code are unique. My variable naming style remains consistent across contests, demonstrating my approach to problem-solving.

If you take a glance at the question then you will realize that the approach to the question is pretty straightforward and most of the submissions have used the same approach. So why only my solution is supposedly marked for plagiarism?? I hope the issue will be resolved soon. Here\u0027s exactly what I received-\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026quot;Attention!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYour solution 289542631 for the problem 2036C significantly coincides with solutions Shivagya/289542631, theblueman/289570204. Such a coincidence is a clear rules violation. Note that unintentional leakage is also a violation. For example, do not use ideone.com with the default settings (public access to your code). If you have conclusive evidence that a coincidence has occurred due to the use of a common source published before the competition, write a comment to post about the round with all the details.

Such violation of the rules may be the reason for blocking your account or other penalties. In case of repeated violations, your account may be blocked.\u0026quot;\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","rating":0}]}
