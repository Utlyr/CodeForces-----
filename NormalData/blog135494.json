And a priority queue where i stored the power ups i didn\u0027t take from the beginning to the current hurdle i need to pass. My tar for every hurdle is the amount of jump power i need — sum(the jump power i have).. when my tar becomes less than 0 i check how many power ups i could initially not take that is in the set that\u0027s why cnt--.. after taking all the power ups before a certain hurdle if my tar is greater than 0 then i just take the power ups in the priority queue untill my tar becomes less than 0 and do cnt++.. if it cant then i do flag \u003d1 and print -1 later on.

Your solution 292032737 for the problem 2037C significantly coincides with solutions asikM/292032737, CheatPlusPlus14/292049353. Such a coincidence is a clear rules violation. Note that unintentional leakage is also a violation. For example, do not use ideone.com with the default settings (public access to your code).
